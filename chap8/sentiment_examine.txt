-1 more precious than perspicacious
-1 it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 
-1 both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
-1 sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
-1 one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
+1 there's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film . . . or the emotional integrity of the performances . 
+1 it has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it's over . 
-1 the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
+1 a perfectly respectable , perfectly inoffensive , easily forgettable film . 
-1 the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
+1 with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in . 
+1 the film occasionally tries the viewer's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story . 
-1 maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
+1 muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they don't have , and how this gets us in trouble . but even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic . 
+1 it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile . 
+1 a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion . 
+1 sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film . 
+1 it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i can't wait for the sequel . 
+1 if there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it's in projects like the ( unfortunately r-rated ) paid . 
+1 in a summer of clones , harvard man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects . 
+1 it's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary . . . 
-1 this isn't a " friday " worth waiting for . 
+1 [the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together . 
-1 every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
+1 noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism . 
+1 isn't quite the equal of woo's best earlier work , but it's easily his finest american film . . . comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films . 
-1 wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway . 
+1 even when foreign directors . . . borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting . 
+1 the movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark ms . bullock's best work in some time . 
+1 the result puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally couldn't care less . 
+1 the closest thing to the experience of space travel
+1 has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of b-movie excitement . 
+1 it's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits . if only it had the story to match . 
+1 the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . 
-1 a bad movie that happened to good actors . 
+1 it's stylishly directed with verve . . . 
-1 the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . 
-1 the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . 
-1 the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 
+1 the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work . 
-1 it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
+1 a joyous occasion
-1 the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off . 
+1 don't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches . . . 
-1 barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
-1 impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie doesn't quite fly . for starters , the story is just too slim . 
+1 a true pleasure . 
-1 amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
-1 not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
-1 it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 
-1 the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
+1 while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . 
-1 feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . 
-1 'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
-1 madonna still can't act a lick . 
+1 savvy director robert j . siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense . 
-1 a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
-1 viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it . 
-1 director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
-1 though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . 
+1 rarely have i seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart . 
+1 those who aren't put off by the film's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them . 
+1 it is quite a vision . 
+1 eric schweig and graham greene both exude an air of dignity that's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters . 
+1 [næs] directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage . 
+1 huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair . 
-1 this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
+1 mr . tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and what time is it there ? should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor . 
-1 what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
-1 sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 
-1 the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation . 
+1 sits uneasily as a horror picture . . . but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family . 
-1 koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
+1 an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that's what makes it worth a recommendation . 
+1 what sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material . 
-1 a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films . 
-1 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
-1 my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
-1 when the first few villians are introduced as " spider " and " snake " you know you're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak . 
-1 egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious . 
+1 the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way . 
+1 whether or not you buy mr . broomfield's findings , the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight , pale mr . broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover . 
-1 i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood . 
+1 it's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series . 
-1 i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 
-1 despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
-1 love liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit . 
-1 guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest . 
-1 a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
+1 though in some ways similar to catherine breillat's fat girl , rain is the far superior film . 
+1 you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes , and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment . 
-1 any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors . 
+1 a solidly constructed , entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration . 
-1 what is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form . 
-1 every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here . 
-1 a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
-1 merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 
-1 this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there . 
+1  . . . either you're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you're not . 
+1 makes the case for a strong education and good teachers being more valuable in the way they help increase an average student's self-esteem , and not strictly in the knowledge imparted . 
+1 films about loss , grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days . seen in that light , moonlight mile should strike a nerve in many . 
-1 the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
+1 like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well . 
-1 overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
-1 i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
-1 a well-acted movie that simply doesn't gel . 
-1 unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
-1 slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
+1 leave it to rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago . 
-1 even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
+1 clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , slap her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up . 
+1 an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood . 
-1 it's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs . -greaseballs mob action-comedy . 
+1 a hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol . 
-1 the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much . 
-1 not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny . 
+1 this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire . 
+1 just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer . 
-1 plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
-1 this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
-1 see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died . 
-1 a dreary movie . 
+1 an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction . 
+1 'charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . . 
-1 i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care . 
+1 kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers . 
-1 scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why . 
+1  . . . a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year . 
+1 medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt . that's why sex and lucia is so alluring . 
-1  . . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
+1 offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works . 
+1 it is nature against progress . in fessenden's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale . 
+1 a gripping drama . 
-1 whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable . 
+1 a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide . 
+1 the one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded . 
+1 on its own , big trouble could be considered a funny little film . 
-1 so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie . 
+1 a meditation on faith and madness , frailty is blood-curdling stuff . 
+1 byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle . instead , he focuses on the anguish that can develop when one mulls leaving the familiar to traverse uncharted ground . 
+1 a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors . 
+1 [an] hilarious romantic comedy . 
-1 so brisk is wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe . 
+1 perhaps the best sports movie i've ever seen . 
-1 it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
+1 rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as monsoon wedding . 
+1 features fincher's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity . 
-1 you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down . 
-1 the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner . 
-1 one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
+1 between them , de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season . 
+1 you have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie's failings . 
-1 horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
-1 intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject . 
-1 the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
-1 as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short . 
-1 for single digits kidlets stuart little 2 is still a no brainer . if you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you'll need a stronger stomach than us . 
+1 finely crafted , finely written , exquisitely performed
+1 the movie is well done , but slow . 
-1 a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film . 
-1 less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . 
-1 was i scared ? only at the prospect of beck's next project . let's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what's next . . . ghost blimp ? 
-1 the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
+1 300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness . 
+1 it's not life-affirming — its vulgar and mean , but i liked it . 
+1 the picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came . 
-1 there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
+1 painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed . 
-1 it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 
-1 the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 
+1 a breezy , diverting , conventional , well-acted tale of two men locked in an ongoing game of cat-and-cat . 
-1 perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
-1 a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
-1 godawful boring slug of a movie . 
+1 what " empire " lacks in depth it makes up for with its heart . 
-1 because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling . 
+1 a dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles the theater provides . 
-1 finally coming down off of miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie . 
-1 it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
-1 ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
+1 ryan gosling . . . is at 22 a powerful young actor . 
+1 a finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere . 
+1 if you ignore the cliches and concentrate on city by the sea's interpersonal drama , it ain't half-bad . 
+1 jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama . 
-1 while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
-1 the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end . 
+1 has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they're not interested . 
+1 just what makes us happy , anyway ? 
+1 a three-hour cinema master class . 
-1 crikey indeed . 
-1 it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious . 
+1 the film delivers what it promises : a look at the " wild ride " that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans . 
+1 lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i couldn't help being captivated by it . 
+1 a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . 
-1 moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured . 
+1 suffice to say that after seeing this movie in imax form , you'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of tom hanks' face than his wife is . 
+1 it's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity . 
+1 brave and sweetly rendered love story . 
+1 craig bartlett and director tuck tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters . 
-1 there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
-1 most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 
+1 connoisseurs of chinese film will be pleased to discover that tian's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus . 
+1 a cartoon that's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore . 
-1 several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
-1 takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
+1 what's infuriating about full frontal is that it's too close to real life to make sense . what's invigorating about it is that it doesn't give a damn . 
-1 a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
+1 a quiet , disquieting triumph . 
-1 some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . 
+1 an odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it didn't try to . 
+1 moretti . . . is the rare common-man artist who's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness . 
-1 this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
+1 a sly female empowerment movie , although not in a way anyone would expect . 
+1 offers an interesting look at the rapidly changing face of beijing . 
-1 has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 
-1 check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
-1 knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail . 
+1 one of the best films i have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense . 
+1 you could say that it's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't , but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable . 
-1 another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
+1  . . . the implication is kissinger may have decided that — when it comes to truncheoning — it's better to give than to receive . 
-1 the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 
+1 a sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters . 
+1 the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring . 
-1 a selection of scenes in search of a movie . 
+1 an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
-1 the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . 
+1 finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original . 
+1 the rich performances by friel -- and especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english -- round out the square edges . 
-1 a non-mystery mystery . 
-1 depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
-1 to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
-1 charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing . 
-1 about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
+1 quitting delivers a sucker-punch , and its impact is all the greater beause director zhang's last film , the cuddly shower , was a non-threatening multi-character piece centered around a public bath house . 
+1 unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly , your first instinct is to duck . 
+1 i like it . there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane . 
+1 the result is something quite fresh and delightful . 
+1 ferrara's best film in years . 
+1 a coming-of-age tale from new zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board . 
+1 nicole kidman makes it a party worth attending . 
+1 efteriades gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug . 
-1 a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
-1 most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 
-1 with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
-1 the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack . 
+1 time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness . 
-1 the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
+1 the comedy makes social commentary more palatable . 
-1 analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in . 
-1 nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay . 
-1 'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '
+1 as green-guts monster movies go , it's a beaut . 
+1  . . . it's as comprehensible as any dummies guide , something even non-techies can enjoy . 
+1 the locations go from stark desert to gorgeous beaches . the story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic . 
-1 return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market . 
-1 it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
+1 this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it . 
+1 combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration . 
+1 this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic . 
-1 a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
+1 based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
+1 a forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself . 
-1 it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived . 
-1 the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
-1 ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
+1 this may be burns's strongest film since the brothers mcmullen . 
-1 [h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by . 
-1 the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
-1 a movie that's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts . 
-1 ver wiel's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless . 
-1 reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
+1 goofy , nutty , consistently funny . and educational ! 
-1 if religious films aren't your bailiwick , stay away . otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 
+1 a thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one's actions . 
-1 technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial . 
+1 the characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life . 
-1 there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
-1  . . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
+1 filled with alexandre desplat's haunting and sublime music , the movie completely transfixes the audience . 
+1 constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act . 
+1 this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder . 
-1 adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
+1 a warm , funny , engaging film . 
-1 it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) . 
+1 the story and structure are well-honed . fresnadillo's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that won't go away . 
-1 this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
-1 apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 
-1 one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year . 
-1 it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . 
-1 the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . 
+1 the mothman prophecies is best when illustrating the demons bedevilling the modern masculine journey . 
-1 little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 
-1  . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs . 
-1 all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
+1 deliciously slow . 
+1 fulfills the minimum requirement of disney animation . 
+1 this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences . 
-1 like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
+1 martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid . 
+1 there's none of the happily-ever -after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage -- and that's part of what makes dover kosashvili's outstanding feature debut so potent . 
+1 amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances . 
+1 despite its flaws , secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions . 
-1 loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . 
+1 a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality . 
-1 swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 
-1 the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity . 
+1 the heat of the moment prevails . it cooks conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle . 
-1 the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
-1 in its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises . 
+1 the hook is the drama within the drama , as an unsolved murder and an unresolved moral conflict jockey for the spotlight . 
+1 the year's greatest adventure , and jackson's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate . 
+1 a superlative b movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing . 
-1 this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
+1 the cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story . 
+1 so fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated . not to mention absolutely refreshed . 
+1 highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 
+1 there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners can't overcome , but it's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling . 
+1 windtalkers blows this way and that , but there's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass , true to himself . 
-1 'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
-1 one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
-1 the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental . 
-1 mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
+1 see it . debate it . remember it . 
-1 hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . 
-1 a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men . 
+1 displaying about equal amounts of naiveté , passion and talent , beneath clouds establishes sen as a filmmaker of considerable potential . 
-1 if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
+1 does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets . 
-1 it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film . 
+1 the footage of the rappers at play and the prison interview with suge knight are just two of the elements that will grab you . 
-1 it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one . 
+1 although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse , the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching . 
-1 completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 
-1 a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . 
-1 there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . 
-1 the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
+1 theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical . 
+1 reign of fire may be little more than another platter of reheated aliens , but it's still pretty tasty . 
+1 fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn . 
-1 stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
-1 even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser . 
+1 much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words don't really do the era justice . you have to see it . 
+1 your children will be occupied for 72 minutes . 
+1 a moving , if uneven , success . 
+1 a glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism . 
+1 not since tom cruise in risky business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear . 
+1 measured against practically any like-themed film other than its oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor the silence of the lambs , red dragon rates as an exceptional thriller . 
+1 birthday girl lucks out with chaplin and kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie's darker turns . 
+1 together , miller , kuras and the actresses make personal velocity into an intricate , intimate and intelligent journey . 
+1 it's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just can't take it any more . 
+1  . . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance
+1 the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar . 
+1 if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of " the isle " you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else . 
-1 any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment . 
-1 cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
+1 the art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and kurys' direction is clever and insightful . 
+1 a weird and wonderful comedy . 
+1 my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie . 
-1  . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might . 
-1 hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
-1 too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film . 
-1 a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy . 
-1 alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
-1 screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
+1 the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission . 
-1 a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men . 
-1 could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? in a word -- yes . 
-1 despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
+1 an enjoyable experience . 
+1 fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense . 
+1 we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood couldn't possibly fictionalize and be believed . 
-1 seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory . 
-1 claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem . 
-1 if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother . 
-1 the film can depress you about life itself . 
-1 absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel . 
-1 admirably ambitious but self-indulgent . 
-1 the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
-1 as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame . 
-1 except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
-1  . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
-1 when the fire burns out , we've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that's where the film ultimately fails . 
-1 clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up . 
-1 it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style . 
+1 nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , warm water may well be the year's best and most unpredictable comedy . 
+1 there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
-1 fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
-1 utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film . 
-1 despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
-1 it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . " interview " loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into . 
+1 the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head . 
-1 national lampoon's van wilder may aim to be the next animal house , but it more closely resembles this year's version of tomcats . 
-1 k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich . 
-1 barely goes beyond comic book status . 
+1 [broomfield] uncovers a story powerful enough to leave the screen sizzling with intrigue . 
+1 none of this is meaningful or memorable , but frosting isn't , either , and you wouldn't turn down a big bowl of that , would you ? 
+1 the ring is worth a look , if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your halloween entertainment . 
+1 there is a subversive element to this disney cartoon , providing unexpected fizzability . 
-1 becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
-1 if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid . 
-1 it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
-1 confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . 
-1 yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
-1 not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through . 
-1 starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
-1 chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum . 
+1 williams creates a stunning , taxi driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity . 
+1 stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation . 
-1 for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . 
-1 plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
+1 altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece . 
+1 while [roman coppola] scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story . 
+1 a high-spirited buddy movie about the reunion of berlin anarchists who face arrest 15 years after their crime . 
-1 wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime . 
+1 a thinly veiled look at different aspects of chinese life clashing with each other . 
+1 succeeds only because bullock and grant were made to share the silver screen . 
-1 directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut . 
-1 as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . 
+1 although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , dogtown and z-boys has a compelling story to tell . 
+1 sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do . 
-1 consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
-1 yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
-1  . . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 
+1 after an uncertain start , murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with bullock's memorable first interrogation of gosling . 
-1 even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
-1 what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
+1 topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs . 
-1 if you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere . 
-1 enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . 
+1 michael moore's latest documentary about america's thirst for violence is his best film yet . . . 
-1 feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work . 
+1 hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship . 
-1 makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
+1 the wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic . 
+1 a dreadful day in irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment . 
+1 the new guy does have a heart . now , if it only had a brain . 
-1 the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
-1 [siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
-1 unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party . 
-1 the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . 
-1 an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
-1 that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
+1 arliss howard's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , big bad love , meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws . 
+1 visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality . 
+1 the salton sea has moments of inspired humour , though every scrap is of the darkest variety . 
+1 the film's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth . 
-1 its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more . 
+1 often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed . 
+1 affectionately reminds us that , in any language , the huge stuff in life can usually be traced back to the little things . 
+1 this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed . 
-1 a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight . 
-1 sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading . 
-1 helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
-1 however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . 
+1 even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end . . . you almost don't notice the 129-minute running time . 
+1 is office work really as alienating as 'bartleby' so effectively makes it ? 
-1 it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
-1 enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting . 
+1 the film has a terrific look and salma hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life . 
+1 <em>ash wednesday</em> is not edward burns' best film , but it is a good and ambitious film . and it marks him as one of the most interesting writer/directors working today . 
+1 what a dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie this is . 
+1  . . . the plot weaves us into a complex web . 
-1 any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
-1 a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing . 
-1 will be far more interesting to the soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by julia roberts . . . 
-1 slap me , i saw this movie . 
-1 it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary . 
+1 it won't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , finch's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee . 
+1 there's lots of cool stuff packed into espn's ultimate x . 
+1 it lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho , without making him any less psycho . 
-1 there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
+1 the early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us . this is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one . it's sort of in-between , and it works . 
-1 a workshop mentality prevails . 
+1 assayas' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of jacques chardonne's novel . 
+1 it's funny , as the old saying goes , because it's true . 
-1 abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
+1 you won't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again . 
-1 cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . 
-1 the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
-1 the movie bounces all over the map . 
-1 off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
-1 the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention . 
-1 the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank . 
-1 it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 
+1 watching these two actors play against each other so intensely , but with restraint , is a treat . 
-1 this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance . 
+1 beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing . 
-1 on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
+1 makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun . 
-1 some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one . 
-1 there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there . 
+1 while the humor is recognizably plympton , he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time . 
-1 like most of jaglom's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . 
+1 maneuvers skillfully through the plot's hot brine -- until it's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors . 
-1 the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
-1 features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
+1 the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it's actually watchable . even more baffling is that it's funny . 
+1 this is what imax was made for : strap on a pair of 3-d goggles , shut out the real world , and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier -- space . 
+1 zhang yimou delivers warm , genuine characters who lie not through dishonesty , but because they genuinely believe it's the only way to bring happiness to their loved ones . 
+1 will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year . 
-1 i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
+1 nicely combines the enigmatic features of 'memento' with the hallucinatory drug culture of 'requiem for a dream . '
-1 the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud . 
-1  . . . they missed the boat . 
+1 you come away from his film overwhelmed , hopeful and , perhaps paradoxically , illuminated . 
+1  . . . there's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages . 
-1 imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . 
-1 'this movie sucks . '
-1 crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama . 
+1 all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure . 
+1 would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . '
-1 sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece . 
-1 the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake . 
-1 a few hours after you've seen it , you forget you've been to the movies . 
-1 waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . 
+1  " red dragon " is entertaining . an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ? but it is entertaining on an inferior level . it is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see . 
-1 a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
+1 in the long , dishonorable history of quickie teen-pop exploitation , like mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency . 
+1 between the drama of cube ? s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results . 
-1 it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
-1 not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . 
+1 more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . 
-1 pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
+1 holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks . 
-1 entertaining enough , but nothing new
-1 it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . 
+1 an awfully good , achingly human picture . 
+1 not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered , but the film works well enough to make it worth watching . 
-1 imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring . 
-1 just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills . 
+1 mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness . 
-1 while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun . 
-1 none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
-1 the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
-1 such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
-1 ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves . 
-1 what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky . 
+1 hardly a film that comes along every day . 
+1 the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design . 
-1 is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
+1 the hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment . 
+1 the film's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter . 
-1 this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . 
+1 if cinema had been around to capture the chaos of france in the 1790's , one imagines the result would look like something like this . 
+1 like leon , it's frustrating and still oddly likable . 
+1 can i admit xxx is as deep as a petri dish and as well-characterized as a telephone book but still say it was a guilty pleasure ? 
+1 a film of quiet power . 
+1 if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . 
-1  . . . too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be . 
-1 ah , the travails of metropolitan life ! alas , another breathless movie about same ! 
+1 the draw [for " big bad love " ] is a solid performance by arliss howard . 
-1 it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating . 
-1 this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
-1 it's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil' bow wow . 
-1 like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
+1 the film's real appeal won't be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers .

-1 winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
-1 the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly… alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .

+1 mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life

-1 by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , . . . actually pretty good . of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad . 
+1 it's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia . 
-1 on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
-1 a listless and desultory affair . 
+1 evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet's " house of games " and last fall's " heist " so much fun .

+1 mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt . 
-1 just a bloody mess . 
-1 even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
-1 like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
-1 this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
-1 a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
-1 the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
+1 the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt's , no matter if it's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale .

-1 millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
-1 a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie . 
+1 after watching it , you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history . 
+1 i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 
-1 ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr . 
-1 the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
+1 good-naturedly cornball sequel . 
-1 just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
+1 though lan yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency , the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude . 
+1 oscar wilde's masterpiece , the importance of being earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century . it's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker's movie adaptation .

+1 washington overcomes the script's flaws and envelops the audience in his character's anguish , anger and frustration .

+1 ao sair do cinema , eu estava feliz e com saudades de um tempo em que , para mim , a existência de papai noel era um fato inquestionável . 
+1 an average kid-empowerment fantasy with slightly above-average brains . 
+1 it may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ? 
+1 manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting .

-1 i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .

+1 with dickens' words and writer-director douglas mcgrath's even-toned direction , a ripping good yarn is told .

+1 flavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with . 
+1 one of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm .

-1 for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless . 
+1 beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '
+1 an incredibly low-rent danish film , it brings a group of people together in a sweet and charming way , if a little convenient
+1 a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign's end , an extended publicity department . 
+1 kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie . and adults will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film's lamer instincts are in the saddle .

+1 an unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud . 
-1 a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad .

-1 what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial . 
+1 [jeff's] gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent .

-1 a simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something . 
+1 a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic . . . 
-1 the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear .

+1 a summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more .

+1 a beautifully observed character piece . 
-1 for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience

-1 do you say " hi " to your lover when you wake up in the morning ?

+1 while scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " gangs " is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about .

-1 though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
-1 more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
+1 where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment . 
-1 [plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy . 
+1 escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie .

-1 woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them . 
-1 contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .

-1 they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right .

+1 the screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a " dungeons and dragons " fantasy with modern military weaponry . . . 
+1 an honest , sensitive story from a vietnamese point of view . 
-1 la de salma es una versión de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ningún contenido . 
+1 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . 
+1 with or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller
-1 a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
-1 the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
-1 it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making . 
-1 if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
-1 like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste . 
+1 more of the same from taiwanese auteur tsai ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director's previous films . 
+1 maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while . 
+1 like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh . 
+1 [shyamalan] continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision . 
+1 a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats . 
-1 its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure . 
+1 while most films these days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world . 
+1 finally , the french-produced " read my lips " is a movie that understands characters must come first . 
-1 equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 . 
-1 goes on and on to the point of nausea . 
+1 the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm . 
-1 an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
-1 stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
+1 greengrass ( working from don mullan's script ) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation . 
-1 a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness . 
+1 a film that will enthrall the whole family . 
-1 obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script . 
-1 less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins . 
-1 these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers . 
+1 it's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more . 
-1  sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
+1 stage director sam mendes showcases tom hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge . 
-1 has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
+1 sly , sophisticated and surprising . 
-1 an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie . 
-1 the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
-1 a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence . 
+1 it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality
+1 this is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller . 
-1 the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
+1 it uses an old-time formula , it's not terribly original and it's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie my big fat greek wedding . 
+1 swimming is above all about a young woman's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds . 
-1 a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
-1 this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
+1 the movie isn't always easy to look at . but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here . 
-1 despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end . 
-1 like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
-1 the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . 
-1 about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
-1 despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
-1 stay away . far away . 
-1 the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . 
+1 here's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep . but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned cannot be said to suck . 
-1 the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
-1 despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
-1 shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan . 
-1 makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
-1 one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful . 
+1 majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . 
-1 build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year . 
+1 the thing about guys like evans is this : you're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins . but as you watch the movie , you're too interested to care . 
+1 for the most part stevens glides through on some solid performances and witty dialogue . 
+1 for the most part , director anne-sophie birot's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama . 
-1 admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
+1 the entire cast is first-rate , especially sorvino . 
+1 the slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters . 
-1 novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 
-1 since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story . 
-1 too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless . 
-1 tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
-1 as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
-1 the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 
+1 everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte , and everything that has to do with yvan's rambunctious , jewish sister and her non-jew husband , feels funny and true . 
-1 john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
+1 by and large this is mr . kilmer's movie , and it's his strongest performance since the doors . 
-1 the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . 
+1 farrell . . . thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis's world-weary colonel . 
-1 bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste . 
-1 it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
-1 it's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner . 
-1 a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 
-1  . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
-1 all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . 
+1 its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director's previous popcorn work . 
-1 a lame comedy . 
-1 tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
+1 the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end . 
-1 while howard's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast . 
+1 the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers . 
+1 an elegant work , food of love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing . 
+1 it's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages . 
+1 the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites . 
-1 so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
-1 represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 
-1 while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . " 
-1 an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay . 
-1 only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . 
+1 [while the last metro] was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history . 
-1 at once half-baked and overheated . 
-1 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
+1 macdowell , whose wifty southern charm has anchored lighter affairs . . . brings an absolutely riveting conviction to her role . 
-1 even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure . 
-1 the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
+1 star/producer salma hayek and director julie taymor have infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own . 
+1 mr . deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy . 
-1 it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
-1 hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
+1 an ambitious movie that , like shiner's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that don't come off . 
-1 the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . 
+1 the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . 
-1 the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
-1 the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
+1 the performances are uniformly good . 
-1 it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
+1 this beautifully animated epic is never dull . 
+1 ou've got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane . 
+1 what makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching . 
+1 martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more . 
+1 as animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth . 
+1 spielberg's picture is smarter and subtler than [total recall and blade runner] , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences . 
+1 unpretentious , charming , quirky , original
-1 scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
+1 a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . 
+1 it rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide . 
+1 the production has been made with an enormous amount of affection , so we believe these characters love each other . 
-1 o ótimo esforço do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos são explicados . 
+1 diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful . 
-1 exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 
-1 there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
-1 like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal . 
+1 one of those rare , exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind . 
+1 [scherfig] has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters' lives after the clever credits roll . 
+1 peppering this urban study with references to norwegian folktales , villeneuve creates in maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical . 
-1 never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . " 
-1 well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
-1 a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 
+1 an inventive , absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
+1 the two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie . 
-1 its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) . 
-1 too simple for its own good . 
+1 highly engaging . 
-1 sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well . 
-1 though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
+1 gooding is the energetic frontman , and it's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences . 
-1 it's not hateful . it's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical . 
-1 it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering . 
-1 in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie . 
-1 a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship . 
+1 apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen . 
-1 barely gets off the ground . 
+1 richard gere and diane lane put in fine performances as does french actor oliver martinez . 
-1 frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for . 
+1 there has to be a few advantages to never growing old . like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you're over 100 . 
+1 'interesante y disfrutable trabajo gracias a que prescinde del clásico elemento estadounidense patriotero y manipulador . '
+1 an eye-boggling blend of psychedelic devices , special effects and backgrounds , 'spy kids 2' is a visual treat for all audiences . 
+1 its direction , its script , and weaver's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that's what you're in the mood for . 
+1 the modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals . it's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after . 
+1 an enchanting film that presents an audacious tour of the past and takes within its warm embrace the bounties of cultural artifacts inside st . petersburg's hermitage museum . 
-1 solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me . 
+1 malcolm mcdowell is cool . paul bettany is cool . paul bettany playing malcolm mcdowell ? cool . 
+1 australian filmmaker david flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them . 
-1 feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women . 
-1 for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
-1 it's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting . 
+1 an ebullient tunisian film about the startling transformation of a tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing . 
-1 starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
-1 lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
-1 the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction . 
-1 all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
+1 it's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured . 
+1 a brutal and funny work . nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully . 
-1 human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard . 
-1 [it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
-1 a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
+1 a thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action . still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences . 
+1 just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain . 
-1 message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
-1 thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces don't quite fit together . 
-1 the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence . 
-1 despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
-1  . . . a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause . 
+1 the film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing . 
-1 festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
-1 the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater . 
+1 piercingly affecting . . . while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying . 
-1 if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
-1 a frustrating 'tweener' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls . 
-1 harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment . 
-1 too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work . 
+1 mr . deeds is , as comedy goes , very silly -- and in the best way . 
+1 the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la
+1  " home movie " is a sweet treasure and something well worth your time . 
-1 as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all . 
+1 [a] wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 
+1 full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , time out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life . 
+1 jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying . 
-1 such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard ! 
-1 the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
-1 an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
+1 consistently clever and suspenseful . 
+1 one-of-a-kind near-masterpiece . 
+1 a stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films
+1 the movie's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries . 
+1 although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey
-1 the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
-1 neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn . 
-1 a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
+1 it cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you . 
+1 a sensitive and astute first feature by anne-sophie birot . 
+1 a melancholy , emotional film . 
+1 fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film . 
-1 slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 
-1 it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
+1 some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat . 
-1 being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
+1 the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff . 
+1 as averse as i usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream hollywood fantasies , this one got to me . 
+1 at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge . 
-1 it's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . 
-1 these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . 
+1 the riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold . 
-1 this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
-1 a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
+1 features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer's block ever . 
-1 adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all . 
-1 as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
+1 only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents . 
+1 offers much to enjoy . . . and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends . 
-1 with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role . 
+1  . . . tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope . 
+1 my wife is an actress works as well as it does because [the leads] are such a companionable couple . 
+1 [ramsay] visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor . 
-1  . . . really horrible drek . 
-1 most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
-1 amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the " other side of the story . " 
+1 what i saw , i enjoyed . 
-1 a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
+1 this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it's hard to know what to praise first . 
-1 halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
+1 certainly the performances are worthwhile . 
-1 starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner . 
+1 [reaches] wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair . 
-1 will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ? 
-1 you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled . 
+1 though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous . 
+1 worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia . 
+1 japanese director shohei imamura's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime . 
+1 a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that isn't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears . 
+1 much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be . 
+1 i am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson . 
-1 evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
-1 a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 
-1 a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan . 
-1 not one moment in the enterprise didn't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow . 
+1 a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama . 
-1 this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved . 
+1 this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you hadn't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point . 
-1 i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
+1 what's most memorable about circuit is that it's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large . . . and small . . . with considerable aplomb . 
-1 barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material . 
+1 there is no denying the power of polanski's film . . . 
-1 it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .

-1 the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .

+1 at times the guys taps into some powerful emotions , but this kind of material is more effective on stage . it's not a motion picture ; it's an utterly static picture . 
+1 if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle . 
-1 a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .

-1 it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable . 
-1 after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
+1 light-years ahead of paint-by-number american blockbusters like pearl harbor , at least artistically . 
+1 sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling . and in this regard , on guard delivers .

-1 too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 
+1 it's like an old warner bros . costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie errol flynn always wanted to make , though bette davis , cast as joan , would have killed him .

+1 a must for fans of british cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride . 
+1 a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino .

-1 the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
-1 i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
-1 un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image . 
-1 like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
-1 while the mystery unravels , the characters respond by hitting on each other . 
-1 the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .

-1 you can practically hear george orwell turning over . 
-1 there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . 
-1 an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength . 
-1 busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
+1 i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible .

-1 the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set . 
-1 life is a crock -- or something like it . 
-1 tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art .

-1  " my god , i'm behaving like an idiot ! " yes , you are , ben kingsley . 
-1 the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .

-1 as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
+1 absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way . 
+1 without ever becoming didactic , director carlos carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality . 
+1 not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense . 
-1 replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
-1 though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
-1 a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
-1 equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
+1 while this movie , by necessity , lacks fellowship's heart , two towers outdoes its spectacle . 
+1 although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs . 
+1 there's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles . 
-1 horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists . 
+1 cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh . not as good as the original , but what is . . . 
+1 never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches . . . gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving . 
+1 captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics . 
-1 this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 
+1 as an introduction to the man's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it's invaluable . 
+1 the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer . 
+1 its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time . 
-1 jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . 
+1 intriguing and downright intoxicating . 
+1 the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one . 
-1 we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict . 
-1 the words , 'frankly , my dear , i don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate . 
+1 earnest , unsubtle and hollywood-predictable , green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese . 
-1 writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '
-1 the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged . 
+1 provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of todd solondz . 
+1 highly watchable stuff . 
-1 an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s . 
+1 there's something poignant about an artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us . 
+1 drama of temptation , salvation and good intentions is a thoughtful examination of faith , love and power . 
+1 'tobey maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '
-1 a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
-1 paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 . 
-1 it's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think . socrates motions for hemlock . 
-1 to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
+1 a thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause . 
+1 this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . 
+1 takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights . 
+1 there aren't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) , but " elling " manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year's most enjoyable releases . 
+1 for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped . for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped . 
+1 a heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers' hearts . 
-1 sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
-1 it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
+1 an effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence . 
+1 uneven but a lot of fun . 
-1 not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest . 
+1 smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes . 
-1 a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
+1 even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . 
+1 red dragon is less baroque and showy than hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than silence . but , like silence , it's a movie that gets under your skin . 
-1 one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution . 
+1 sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy . . . attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called 'my husband is travis bickle' . 
+1 it's always fascinating to watch marker the essayist at work . 
-1  . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
+1 an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent . 
-1 opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen . 
+1 solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike . 
-1 possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose . 
-1 with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails . 
+1 disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids' books to the screen . . . tuck everlasting is a little of both . 
-1 rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 
-1 the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster . 
+1 the movie should be credited with remembering his victims . 
+1 this is an extraordinary film , not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal . 
+1 sweet home alabama isn't going to win any academy awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts . 
-1 with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool . 
+1 even if the ring has a familiar ring , it's still unusually crafty and intelligent for hollywood horror . 
+1 well-written , nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored , the film works on several levels , openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull . 
+1 rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid . . . 
-1 not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 
+1 binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles . 
-1 despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
+1 if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann's revolution no . 9 . 
-1 an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously . 
+1 it may . . . work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns . 
-1 with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
+1 it's good to see michael caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again . 
-1 equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 
-1 the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books . 
+1 vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order . 
+1 delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information . 
+1 even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough . every child's story is what matters . this film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost . 
+1 effective but too-tepid biopic
+1 an absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true . 
+1 lan yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most american love stories look downright unfree . 
-1 veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda . 
-1 it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you . 
-1 there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . 
+1 another best of the year selection . 
+1 offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film . 
-1 the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
-1 weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 
+1 [gosling's] combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character . 
+1 the strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting . 
-1 the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
-1 shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
-1 tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
-1 if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead . 
+1 as allen's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator david presson . 
-1 a moving picture that does not move . 
-1 the material and the production itself are little more than routine . 
+1 although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there's no denying the fun of watching de niro and crystal having fun . 
-1 has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting . 
+1 an elegant , exquisitely modulated psychological thriller . 
-1 an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
-1 the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . " 
+1 the movie is brilliant , really . it is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events . 
+1 it may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that cannot be denied . 
+1 while the isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic , its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at . 
-1 richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold . 
+1 a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage . 
+1 one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce . 
-1 pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler . 
+1 the film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed . 
+1 the director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of truffaut . 
-1 too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet . 
+1 a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail . 
+1 it's a treat watching shaw , a british stage icon , melting under the heat of phocion's attentions . 
-1 howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective . 
-1 reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . 
-1 an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 
+1 terrific performances , great to look at , and funny . a little uneven to be the cat's meow , but it's good enough to be the purr . 
-1 both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
+1 for those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s , the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed . 
+1 another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez . 
+1 visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last . 
+1 seeing seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy , even though the reality is anything but . 
-1 trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible . 
-1 what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor . 
-1 wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 
+1 captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world . 
-1 broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
+1 hey , who else needs a shower ? 
+1 it's hard to imagine alan arkin being better than he is in this performance . 
-1 the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . 
+1 bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era's creme de la celluloid . 
+1 parker cannot sustain the buoyant energy level of the film's city beginnings into its country conclusion
-1 a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
-1 less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . 
-1 bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that . 
+1 it may be a no-brainer , but at least it's a funny no-brainer . 
-1  . . . hokey art house pretension . 
-1 i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations . it's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun . 
+1 hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels . 
-1 dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled . 
+1 poetic , heartbreaking . 
+1 george clooney proves he's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind . 
+1 as unseemly as its title suggests . 
-1 not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
-1 the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
-1 a dreadful live-action movie . 
-1 the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about . 
+1 with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives . 
-1  . . . one resurrection too many . 
+1 while it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight . 
-1 it's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . 
+1 the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by . 
-1 wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '
-1 faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
-1 there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time . 
+1 twohy's a good yarn-spinner , and ultimately the story compels . 
-1 impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
-1 there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture . 
+1 a polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con . 
+1 spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don' t know an orc from a uruk-hai . 
+1 a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more . 
+1  " the dangerous lives of altar boys " has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
+1 not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics . 
+1 a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of 'home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households . 
+1 a distinguished and thoughtful film , marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances . 
-1 [gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience . 
-1 the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
-1 boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 
+1 don't judge this one too soon - it's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going . 
-1 lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
+1 while not all that bad of a movie , it's nowhere near as good as the original . 
+1 to those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer's 'divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood , ' but that's not saying much . 
-1 the master of disguise is funny--not " ha ha " funny , " dead circus performer " funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides . 
-1 offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life . 
-1 mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
+1 murderous maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud . . . and parmentier . 
-1 this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines . 
-1 some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 
+1 famuyiwa's feature deals with its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner , rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the cliché-riddled genre can offer . 
-1 every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy . half past dead is just such an achievement . 
+1 it's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech . 
-1 no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
-1 how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us . 
-1 there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
-1 it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
+1 it is interesting and fun to see goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen . 
+1 there is a kind of attentive concern that hoffman brings to his characters , as if he has been giving them private lessons , and now it is time for their first public recital . 
-1  . . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
-1 [the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 
-1 a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . 
-1 nohe has made a decent 'intro' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant . 
-1 it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 
+1 vereté has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs . 
-1 a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
+1 you can sip your vintage wines and watch your merchant ivory productions ; i'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a jerry bruckheimer flick any day of the week . 
-1 let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears . 
-1 trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax einstein's brain . 
-1 jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically . 
+1 open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny . 
+1 [a] rare movie that makes us re-assess the basis for our lives and evaluate what is truly ours in a world of meaningless activity . 
-1 i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women . 
-1 the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
+1 director-writer bille august . . . depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey martin's deterioration and barbara's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger . 
+1 happily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet . 
+1  . . . blade ii is more enjoyable than the original . 
-1 this tuxedo . . . should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations . 
+1 features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film . 
+1 until ( the ) superfluous . . . epilogue that leaks suspension of disbelief like a sieve , die another day is as stimulating & heart-rate-raising as any james bond thriller . 
+1 enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers . 
-1 holden caulfield did it better . 
+1 if you can swallow its absurdities and crudities lagaan really is enormously good fun . 
+1 by the time we learn that andrew's turnabout is fair play is every bit as awful as borchardt's coven , we can enjoy it anyway . 
-1 just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
+1 insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances . 
+1 conceptually brilliant . . . plays like a living-room war of the worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown . 
-1 like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery . 
-1  . . . if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you're in for a painful ride . 
-1 we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest . 
-1 'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
-1 there's a lot of good material here , but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it . 
-1 there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it . 
-1 it's all surface psychodramatics . 
+1 allen se atreve a atacar , a atacarse y nos ofrece gags que van de la sonrisa a la risa de larga duración
+1 although made on a shoestring and unevenly acted , conjures a lynch-like vision of the rotting underbelly of middle america . 
+1 for anyone unfamiliar with pentacostal practices in general and theatrical phenomenon of hell houses in particular , it's an eye-opener . 
+1 the best animated feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago . 
+1 throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh . 
-1 big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 
+1 shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral . extraordinary debut from josh koury . 
-1 …its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself . 
+1 discursive but oddly riveting documentary . 
-1 as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
+1 escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions . 
+1 chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution . 
-1 like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
+1 angel presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale . 
+1 this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain . 
+1 is truth stranger than fiction ? in [screenwriter] charlie kaufman's world , truth and fiction are equally strange , and his for the taking . 
+1 fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment . 
-1 well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) . 
-1 the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys . 
+1  " spider-man is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer , and hopefully , sets the tone for a summer of good stuff . if you're a comic fan , you can't miss it . if you're not , you'll still have a good time . " 
+1 the pinochet case is a searing album of remembrance from those who , having survived , suffered most . 
+1 like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 
-1 director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters . 
-1 the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
-1 a pretentious mess . 
+1 an eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake . 
-1 frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . . 
+1 ryan gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted daniel . 
+1 the ingenuity that parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of wilde himself . 
-1 the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr . deeds was to that of frank capra . 
+1 most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness . 
-1  . . . a movie that , quite simply , shouldn't have been made . 
+1 noyce has worked wonders with the material . 
+1 everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there , for everybody who wants to be a kid again , or show it to their own kids . 
+1 overall , interesting as a documentary -- but not very imaxy . 
+1 waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it . 
+1 this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success . 
-1 ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . ignore the reputation , and ignore the film . 
+1 writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured . 
+1 corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . it's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain . at all . 
-1 i hate this movie
-1 everyone's to blame here . 
-1 curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary . 
+1 absorbing character study by andré turpin . 
-1 it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either . 
+1 nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition . 
+1 though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation . 
+1 takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms . 
-1 well-made but mush-hearted . 
+1 a piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness . 
+1 some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time . 
-1 the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course . 
-1 none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens . 
-1 a well-crafted letdown . 
-1 rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations . 
+1 massoud's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history . 
-1 the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .

-1 even in this less-than-magic kingdom , reese rules . 
+1 occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective .

-1 britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
+1 it's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it didn't entirely grab me , but there's stuff here to like . 
-1 very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in " stuart little 2 " : there's just no story , folks . 
-1 for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . 
-1 the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
+1 mordantly funny and intimately knowing . . . 
-1 green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project .

+1 this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years . 
+1 this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it . 
+1 writer/director joe carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . 
-1 [seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
-1 it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni .

+1 both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right . 
-1 unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it . wait for video -- and then don't rent it . 
-1 the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd . it's all pretty cynical and condescending , too . 
-1 when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
-1 the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
-1 an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
+1 if you're not into the pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years won't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open . but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi . 
-1 rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
+1 it's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .

-1 i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . . 
+1 dogtown & z-boys evokes the blithe rebel fantasy with the kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of james dean . 
-1 it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . 
+1 the bourne identity shouldn't be half as entertaining as it is , but director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood . 
+1 because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions . 
+1 frailty isn't as gory or explicit . but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing . 
+1  ( caine ) proves once again he hasn't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film . 
-1 mediocre fable from burkina faso . 
-1 the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
-1 it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
-1 i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .

+1 the most compelling performance of the year adds substantial depth to this shocking testament to anti-semitism and neo-fascism . 
+1 ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer's memory .

+1  . . . a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor . 
-1 takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny .

+1 whether you're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you'll still feel something . 
-1 the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder . 
-1 formulaic to the 51st power , more like . 
-1 the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . 
+1 it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period .

-1 i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him . 
+1 the setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of " intacto's " dangerous and seductively stylish game .

+1 the way coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining . 
-1 serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . 
+1 it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth .

+1 offers a persuasive look at a defeated but defiant nation in flux . 
-1 i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes .
