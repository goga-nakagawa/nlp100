-1 you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
+1 it uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film . the result is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking . 
+1 at the end , when the now computerized yoda finally reveals his martial artistry , the film ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside . 
-1 movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
+1 it's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . you don't want to call the cops . you want to call domino's .

+1 a gripping drama . 
-1 some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . 
+1 romanek keeps the film constantly taut . . . reflecting the character's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score . 
-1 self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
-1 a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . 
-1  . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
-1 the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 
-1 it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
+1 by the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better . 
+1 features fincher's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity . 
+1 russian ark is a new treasure of the hermitage . 
-1 might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper . 
-1 suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal . 
-1 the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
-1 talky , artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture . 
-1 the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch . 
-1 sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
-1 femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
+1 the direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by harris , phifer and cam'ron seal the deal . 
-1 why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc . , be more valuable ? 
-1 nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
-1 i'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks . 
-1 for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
-1 this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 
-1 i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . 
+1 works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren . 
-1 brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
-1 the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
+1 a wildly funny prison caper . 
+1 i've yet to find an actual vietnam war combat movie actually produced by either the north or south vietnamese , but at least now we've got something pretty damn close . 
-1 this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
-1 so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
-1 harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment . 
-1 it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
-1 hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .

-1 had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
+1 throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all , nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another . 
+1 the film delivers what it promises : a look at the " wild ride " that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans . 
+1 filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home . 
+1 a perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy . 
+1 what could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman's tragic odyssey . 
+1 despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show . . . represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it . 
-1 it's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . 
+1 with the prospect of films like kangaroo jack about to burst across america's winter movie screens it's a pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative . 
-1 will give many ministers and bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted .

+1 contrived as this may sound , mr . rose's updating works surprisingly well . 
+1 enjoyably dumb , sweet , and intermittently hilarious -- if you've a taste for the quirky , steal a glimpse . 
-1 i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
+1 a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist . 
-1 began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course . 
-1 the words , 'frankly , my dear , i don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .

+1 one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece .

+1  . . . a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing . 
-1 a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . 
-1 it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
+1 a dreadful day in irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment . 
+1 enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd . 
+1 a tale of horror and revenge that is nearly perfect in its relentless descent to the depths of one man's tortured soul . 
-1 an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay . 
-1 chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
-1 [allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 
-1 an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences . 
+1 could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals .

-1 it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
-1 this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
-1 wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
+1 the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task . 
+1 much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive . 
+1 the movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , rocky-like moments . . . but it's such a warm and charming package that you'll feel too happy to argue much . 
-1 a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy . 
-1 a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising . 
-1 at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
+1 mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt . 
+1 what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity . 
+1 as warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated . 
+1 k 19 stays afloat as decent drama/action flick
+1 mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun . 
+1 well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin . 
-1 the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
+1 this is as respectful a film as byatt fans could hope for , though lovers of the book may wonder why it's necessary . 
-1 the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice . 
+1 superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen . 
-1 an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus . if only there were one for this kind of movie . 
+1 the movie's eventual success should be credited to dennis quaid , in fighting trim shape as an athlete as well as an actor
+1 a fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles . 
-1 the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
+1 astonishing . . . [frames] profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment . 
+1 has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be . 
-1 the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
+1 despite its floating narrative , this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film . 
+1 coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching . 
+1 although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs . 
+1 even if you don't think [kissinger's] any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch . 
+1 for the first time in several years , mr . allen has surpassed himself with the magic he's spun with the hollywood empress of ms . leoni's ellie . 
+1 a woman's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken . 
-1 eh . 
+1 it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise . 
+1 a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign's end , an extended publicity department . 
+1 secret ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving . 
-1 a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
-1 empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either . 
+1 pacino is the best he's been in years and keener is marvelous . 
-1 it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue . 
-1 kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) . 
-1 this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
+1 no worse a film than breaking out , and breaking out was utterly charming . 
+1 a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market . 
-1 is " ballistic " worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer . 
-1 a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
+1 [majidi] makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day . 
+1 an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you're getting its metaphysical point . 
+1 cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression . 
-1 execrable . 
+1 it's a treat watching shaw , a british stage icon , melting under the heat of phocion's attentions . 
+1 it's burns' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown . 
+1 what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors . 
+1 turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting . 
+1 just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over . 
+1 ferrara directs the entire film with the kind of detachment that makes any given frame look like a family's custom-made christmas card . 
-1 it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
+1 it's like a " big chill " reunion of the baader-meinhof gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists . 
+1 'pocas veces es posible ver un elenco tan compenetrado con la historia , donde todos y cada uno de los actores ofrecen actuaciones verdaderamente memorables . '
+1 miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images . 
-1 the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
+1 the enjoyable undercover brother , a zany mix of saturday night live-style parody , '70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy . 
+1 if you don't flee , you might be seduced . if you don't laugh , flee . 
+1 vividly conveys both the pitfalls and the pleasures of over-the-top love . 
+1 creeps you out in high style , even if nakata did it better . 
+1 [moore's] better at fingering problems than finding solutions . but though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more . 
+1 may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation . 
+1 a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . 
-1 it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots . 
+1 a movie where story is almost an afterthought amidst a swirl of colors and inexplicable events . 
+1 not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral--and , hence , more chillingly effective . 
-1 feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work . 
+1 cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio . 
+1 y tu mamá también es un buen filme gracias a lo poco convencional de su narrativa , y es quizá el proyecto más arriesgado en la carrera de alfonso cuarón
-1 it's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination . 
-1 it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense . 
+1 easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-semitism ever seen on screen . 
+1 a surprisingly 'solid' achievement by director malcolm d . lee and writer john ridley . 
+1 a sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy , while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that , while past , really isn't . 
+1 what makes it worth watching is quaid's performance . 
-1  " abandon " will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
-1 halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
-1 possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another . 
-1 hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading . 
+1 it's a strange film , one that was hard for me to warm up to . 
-1 shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . 
-1 overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film . 
-1 i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
+1 admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form . 
-1 this would-be 'james bond for the extreme generation' pic is one big , dumb action movie . stress 'dumb . '
-1 no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
-1 poor ben bratt couldn't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions . 
+1 a knowing look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor . 
+1 while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor . 
+1 [an] absorbing documentary . 
-1 has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
-1 'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide . 
-1 one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
+1 what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . 
+1 it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back . 
-1 feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk . 
-1 the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
+1 the appearance of treebeard and gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing , or rolling your eyes . i loved it ! gollum's 'performance' is incredible ! 
-1 a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact . 
-1 to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
-1 although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
-1 certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
+1 one of the year's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces . 
+1 unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly , your first instinct is to duck . 
-1 it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
-1 truly terrible . 
+1 the writing is clever and the cast is appealing . 
-1 your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make . 
+1 a few artsy flourishes aside , narc is as gritty as a movie gets these days . 
+1 lan yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery . 
+1 the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
+1 though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia's true emotions . . . but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking . 
+1 would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can ? do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man's body ? if you answered yes , by all means enjoy the new guy . 
-1 the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity . 
-1 splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . 
+1 grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect . 
+1 a heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope . 
+1 it's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space . 
-1 a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
+1 it will break your heart many times over . 
-1 this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
+1 it's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit . 
-1 coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
-1 it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly . 
-1 boy oh boy , it's a howler . 
-1 watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
+1 symbolically , warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal . 
+1 the performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . 
+1 irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy . 
+1 it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise . 
-1 maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't . 
+1 haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration . 
+1 fudges fact and fancy with such confidence that we feel as if we're seeing something purer than the real thing . 
-1 feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 
-1 the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses – and ours – and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
+1 satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity . 
+1 you have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie's failings . 
+1 a delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach . 
-1 lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings . 
+1 ao sair do cinema , eu estava feliz e com saudades de um tempo em que , para mim , a existência de papai noel era um fato inquestionável . 
-1 what's next ? the porky's revenge : ultimate edition ? 
+1 you won't like roger , but you will quickly recognize him . and that's a big part of why we go to the movies . 
-1 maybe leblanc thought , " hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . " 
-1 a well-crafted letdown . 
-1 the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles . 
-1 surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
+1 the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring . 
+1  " punch-drunk love " is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . . 
-1 bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences . 
-1  . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
+1 an enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar . 
-1 busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
+1 i liked a lot of the smaller scenes . 
-1 a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence . 
-1 every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie ! 
-1 a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
-1 unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
+1 this odd , distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film . 
-1 passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings . 
-1 it's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 
+1 a subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; the pianist does not . 
-1 tennessee williams by way of oprah's book club . 
-1 a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
+1 an inspiring and heart-affecting film about the desperate attempts of vietnamese refugees living in u . s . relocation camps to keep their hopes alive in 1975 . 
-1 comedy troupe broken lizard's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot . 
-1 donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences . 
-1 has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness . 
-1 the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
+1 beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing . 
-1 director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters . 
-1 the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
+1 contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii
+1 a gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost . 
+1 without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions . 
+1 this is dicaprio's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year . 
-1 the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
+1 watching this film , what we feel isn't mainly suspense or excitement . the dominant feeling is something like nostalgia . 
-1 her film is like a beautiful food entrée that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
-1 pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . 
+1 not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it . 
+1 very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both . 
+1 adam sandler ! in an art film ! 
+1 the filmmakers wisely decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him . 
+1 cuts right through the b . s . giving a big middle-fingered " shut up " to those who talk up what is nothing more than two guys beating the hell outta one another . 
-1 consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
-1 it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
-1 it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
+1 alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie . . . tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life . 
+1 all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us . 
+1 a tender , heartfelt family drama . 
-1 this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio . 
-1 parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
-1 a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
+1 one of the most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme shockers since the evil dead . 
+1 japanese director shohei imamura's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime . 
-1 twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 
-1 more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller . 
-1 an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
-1 ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
+1 i encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale's tale -- you won't be sorry ! 
+1 escapism in its purest form . 
-1 adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
+1 it's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look . 
+1 visually striking and viscerally repellent . 
+1 so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor . 
+1 like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film . 
+1 a hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol . 
-1 the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus . 
-1 the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . 
-1 the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 
-1 it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
-1 for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
+1 like leon , it's frustrating and still oddly likable . 
-1 the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
-1 it's drab . it's uninteresting . it squanders chan's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt ! 
+1 this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic . 
-1 writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 
+1 witty dialog between realistic characters showing honest emotions . it's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor . like blended shades of lipstick , these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs . 
+1 the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience . it has fun being grown up . 
-1 not even the hanson brothers can save it
-1 the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
+1 working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli . . . ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up . 
+1 the heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death . 
+1 alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and isn't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience . 
-1 nothing more than a mediocre trifle . 
-1 there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
+1 lapaglia's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class . 
-1 sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard . 
+1 if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch . 
-1 bottom-rung new jack city wannabe . 
+1 here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get . 
-1 below is well below expectations . 
+1 lightweight but appealing . 
-1 that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout . 
-1 a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
-1 it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
+1 schaeffer isn't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does . 
-1 the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power . 
+1 the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back . 
+1 texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare . 
-1 even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
+1 it's something of the ultimate scorsese film , with all the stomach-turning violence , colorful new york gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas . 
+1 consummate actor barry has done excellent work here . 
-1  " one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? " um… . . isn't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
-1 only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . 
-1 a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
-1  . . . if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you're in for a painful ride . 
+1 it's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth . 
-1 never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance . 
-1 bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . 
+1 almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like " the addams family " to everyone looking in . . . " my big fat greek wedding " comes from the heart . . . 
+1 chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement . 
+1 it's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of sarah and harrison . 
+1 it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing . 
-1 it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen . 
-1 a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures . 
-1 o ótimo esforço do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos são explicados . 
-1 has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 
+1 as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet's airless cinematic shell games . 
-1 when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up . 
+1 an ideal love story for those intolerant of the more common saccharine genre . 
-1 so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . 
-1 whether it's the worst movie of 2002 , i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title . 
+1 the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish . 
-1 this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
-1 the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
+1 an enthralling aesthetic experience , one that's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty . 
-1 stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's " waking up in reno . " go back to sleep . 
-1 a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust . 
-1 with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 
+1 a movie of riveting power and sadness . 
-1 succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . 
-1 hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 
+1 the viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers . 
-1 it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
+1 [f]rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels . 
-1 it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be . 
-1 as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
-1 equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 
+1 contradicts everything we've come to expect from movies nowadays . instead of simply handling conventional material in a conventional way , secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way . 
-1 there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
-1 has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
-1 sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed . 
-1 it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
-1 as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
+1 resourceful and ingenious entertainment . 
+1 notorious c . h . o . has oodles of vulgar highlights . 
+1 as a witness to several greek-american weddings -- but , happily , a victim of none -- i can testify to the comparative accuracy of ms . vardalos' memories and insights . 
-1 a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director kurt wimmer at the screenplay level . 
+1 while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . 
-1 good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction . 
-1 a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
-1 one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever . 
-1 a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world . 
-1 the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner . 
-1 it's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you'll feel like mopping up , too . 
-1 if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
+1 it's mostly a pleasure to watch . and the reason for that is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence . 
-1 has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 
+1 for 95 often hilarious minutes , [cho] riffs on the diciness of colonics , on straight versus gay personal ads , on how men would act if they had periods , and on the perils of a certain outré sexual practice . 
+1 skins has a desolate air , but eyre , a native american raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor . 
+1 the quiet american isn't a bad film , it's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar . 
+1 immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop djs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch . 
+1 as green-guts monster movies go , it's a beaut . 
-1 the pool drowned me in boredom . 
+1 the movie is . . . very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes . 
+1 this is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope . 
+1 visually , 'santa clause 2' is wondrously creative . 
+1 the mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs . 
-1 even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
+1 this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you hadn't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point . 
-1 when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it . 
-1 seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore . 
-1 dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away . it's a buggy drag . 
-1 an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more . 
+1 a biopic about crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video . 
+1 kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story . parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults . 
+1 a witty , low-key romantic comedy . 
-1 almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
+1 the filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching . 
+1 an intoxicating experience . 
-1 it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff . 
+1 sparkles in its deft portrait of tinseltown's seasoned veterans of gossip , wealth , paranoia , and celebrityhood . 
+1 windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop . 
-1 nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
-1 confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . 
+1 my wife is an actress works as well as it does because [the leads] are such a companionable couple . 
-1 given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . 
+1 the way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful . 
-1 a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man's quest to find an old flame . 
-1 if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained . 
-1 the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
+1 harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . 
+1 a subtle , humorous , illuminating study of politics , power and social mobility . 
+1 darkly funny and frequently insightful . 
+1 the entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood . 
-1 offers absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen . 
-1 what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
-1 it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
-1 what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
+1 when a movie has stuck around for this long , you know there's something there . it's that good . 
-1 the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks . 
+1 an emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes , with the right actors and with the kind of visual flair that shows what great cinema can really do . 
-1 any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . 
+1 as refreshing as a drink from a woodland stream . 
-1 sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation . 
-1 a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not . 
-1 if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles . 
-1 [carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
+1 close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash-cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air . 
-1 no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film . 
-1 oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
-1 i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
-1 el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors . 
+1 a film of ideas and wry comic mayhem . 
-1 displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
-1 not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
-1  . . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
-1 even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
+1 plunges you into a reality that is , more often then not , difficult and sad , and then , without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision . 
-1 the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
+1 to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed . 
-1 adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized . but what are adults doing in the theater at all ? 
+1 a great companion piece to other napoleon films . 
+1 jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers . 
+1 maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while . 
+1 it's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be . but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds . 
+1 the film is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor . 
+1 what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music . 
+1 it is scott's convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph . 
-1 isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
-1 this isn't a " friday " worth waiting for . 
-1 quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
-1 its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
-1 predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . 
-1 at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
-1 men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . . 
-1 ah , the travails of metropolitan life ! alas , another breathless movie about same ! 
-1 none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor . 
+1 this rich , bittersweet israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man pasach'ke burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines . 
+1 the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . 
-1 they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
+1 [barry] gives assassin a disquieting authority . 
+1 the film will appeal to discovery channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses . 
-1 we get the comedy we settle for . 
+1 with not a lot of help from the screenplay ( proficient , but singularly cursory ) , [testud] acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis . 
-1 too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 
+1 'si bien no logra desarrollarse como un gran drama , tampoco es tan superficial como muchas cintas que pecan de pretenciosas y que resultan totalmente banales . '
-1 bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
-1 thoroughly awful . 
-1 [davis] wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters . 
-1 the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
-1 whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting . 
+1 a taut psychological thriller that doesn't waste a moment of its two-hour running time . 
+1 the modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals . it's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after . 
-1 suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands . 
+1 whether or not you buy mr . broomfield's findings , the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight , pale mr . broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover . 
-1 ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
-1  . . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . 
-1 so few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler . 
+1 with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in . 
-1 the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . 
+1 singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs — a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story — but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece . 
-1 eight legged freaks ? no big hairy deal . 
-1 a feeble tootsie knockoff . 
+1 for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars . 
-1 a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 
-1 reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . 
+1 there's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache . 
+1 davis . . . gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbeal-style fantasy sequences . 
+1 it's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son's room . 
-1 stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here… . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
+1 a cautionary tale about the grandiosity of a college student who sees himself as impervious to a fall . 
-1 the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
+1 the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy . 
+1 who needs mind-bending drugs when they can see this , the final part of the 'qatsi' trilogy , directed by godfrey reggio , with music by philip glass ? 
+1 an engaging criminal romp that will have viewers guessing just who's being conned right up to the finale . 
-1 its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
-1 partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
+1 one of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling blair witch or the others . 
-1 a lame comedy . 
+1 together writer-director danny verete's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt . 
-1 a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level . 
-1 some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
-1 supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
+1 a pleasant piece of escapist entertainment . 
-1 a incompetência de marcus adams como roteirista só é superada por sua péssima direção . 
+1 spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don' t know an orc from a uruk-hai . 
-1 sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you .

+1 interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story . 
-1 instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone .

+1 offers a persuasive look at a defeated but defiant nation in flux . 
-1 kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
+1  . . . a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year . 
+1 may be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since town and country . 
+1 oddly compelling . 
-1 it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from .

+1 a slick , skillful little horror film . 
-1 too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash . 
-1 the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction . 
+1 pretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura . 
-1 clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
+1 ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years . 
-1 the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal . 
-1 diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan . 
+1 a glorious mess . 
-1 the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
+1 i like it . there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane . 
+1 a very witty take on change , risk and romance , and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth . 
-1 any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment . 
+1 oh , james ! your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality , and get this , madonna's cameo doesn't suck ! 
+1 altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece . 
-1 an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship . 
-1 all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
-1 instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized . 
+1 the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game .

-1 terminally brain dead production . 
-1 silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another . 
-1 well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
+1 nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you . he makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty . 
+1 the picture's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed . 
-1 like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
+1 a work of astonishing delicacy and force . 
+1 sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero . 
+1 on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique . 
+1 it's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash . , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it's what makes their project so interesting . 
-1 it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull . 
-1 bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad . 
-1 the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
-1 mildly entertaining . 
+1 seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil . 
-1 whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the " soon-to-be-forgettable " section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
+1  . . . flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . 
+1 a smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist .

+1 quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor . 
+1 a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution . 
-1 a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba . 
-1 sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . 
-1 the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers . 
-1 fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
+1 this is what imax was made for : strap on a pair of 3-d goggles , shut out the real world , and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier -- space . 
-1 the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
+1 this new zealand coming-of-age movie isn't really about anything . when it's this rich and luscious , who cares ?

-1 this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen . 
-1 the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
-1 a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs . and neither do cliches , no matter how 'inside' they are . 
-1 as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor . 
+1 beautifully produced . 
-1 director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . 
+1 a sharp satire of desperation and cinematic deception .

+1 the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic .

-1 with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
-1 newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept – a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
+1 the quirky and recessive charms of co-stars martin donovan and mary-louise parker help overcome the problematic script . 
-1 an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
+1 mr . tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and what time is it there ? should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor .

-1 the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
+1 it's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world . 
+1 a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children's television . 
-1 it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .

-1 wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn . 
+1 ms . fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn . 
+1 a conventional but heartwarming tale .

+1 for movie lovers as well as opera lovers , tosca is a real treat . 
-1 the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
-1 don't waste your money . 
+1 shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes . 
-1 sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
-1 if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . 
-1 not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
+1 a mess when it comes to the characters and writing . . . but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory . 
-1 the most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine . 
-1 the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly . 
-1 the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
-1 it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
-1 about one in three gags in white's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook . 
+1  . . . is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny ) , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality . 
+1 the rich performances by friel -- and especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english -- round out the square edges . 
+1 this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride . 
-1 sayles . . . once again strands his superb performers in the same old story . 
-1 bearable . barely . 
+1 a very funny movie . 
+1 franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance sonny needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic . 
+1 a charming yet poignant tale of the irrevocable ties that bind . 
+1 a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich . 
+1 the characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life . 
+1  . . . pray doesn't have a passion for the material . he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race .

+1 enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later . 
-1 it treats women like idiots . 
-1 no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas . 
-1 not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
+1 despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams " bathroom break ! " 
-1 although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
+1 wonder , hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along , especially if it begins with the name of star wars
+1 as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
+1  . . . takes the beauty of baseball and melds it with a story that could touch anyone regardless of their familiarity with the sport
+1 the 1960s rebellion was misdirected : you can't fight your culture . 
-1 chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror . 
+1 benefits from a strong performance from zhao , but it's dong jie's face you remember at the end . 
-1 alternately frustrating and rewarding . 
+1 ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints . 
-1 the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
-1 it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
+1 payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey , featuring a pathetic , endearing hero who is all too human . 
-1 the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
+1 nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity . . . 
-1 can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
+1 captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics . 
-1 an intriguing near-miss . 
-1 with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 . 
-1 the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief . 
-1 this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
-1 i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink . 
+1 like smoke signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama
+1 a sly game of cat and mouse that's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances . 
-1 stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
+1 don't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life . 
+1 it's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all . 
+1 for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale . 
-1 an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
+1 this is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style . 
-1 glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism . 
+1 passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone . 
+1 it's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that's actually sort of amazing . 
+1 a directorial tour de force by bernard rose , ivans xtc . is one of this year's very best pictures .

-1 everyone's to blame here . 
-1 despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
-1 'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck . 
+1 culkin , who's in virtually every scene , shines as a young man who uses sarcastic lies like a shield . 
-1 the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
-1 this is really just another genre picture . 
-1 the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything .

+1 a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners . 
-1 a picture as erratic as its central character . 
+1 delirious fun .

+1 this is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary ! 
+1 it's a rare window on an artistic collaboration . 
+1 like shrek , spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 
-1 this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
+1 poignant japanese epic about adolescent anomie and heartbreak . 
-1 the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
+1 the hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment . 
-1 director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
+1 like kissing jessica stein , amy's orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor . 
+1 a slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time . 
+1 there are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it's going to be a trip . igby goes down is one of those movies . 
+1 fulfills the minimum requirement of disney animation . 
+1 stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid . 
-1 by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
+1 a lovely film for the holiday season . 
-1 it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective . 
+1 a movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well . 
+1 this one is strictly a lightweight escapist film . 
-1 low rent from frame one . 
-1 this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
+1 the film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life . 
+1 fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment . 
+1 [stephen] earnhart's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have . 
-1 this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
+1 it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period . 
+1 what it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart . 
+1 audacious-impossible yet compelling . . . 
+1 a classy , sprightly spin on film . 
-1 as it stands it's an opera movie for the buffs . 
+1 as unseemly as its title suggests . 
+1 it's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor . 
-1 if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins . 
-1 the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
-1 woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie . 
-1 the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
-1 rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
+1 a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty . 
-1 as an actor , the rock is aptly named . 
-1 this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september . 
-1 devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special . 
+1 marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary . 
-1 although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke . 
-1 the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
-1 sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
-1 none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him . 
+1 demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful , subjective filmmaking . 
-1 gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
+1 decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like . the unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful .

+1 its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing .

+1 vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two english women . 
-1 it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
-1 choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy . 
-1 stale , futile scenario . 
+1 i'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute . 
+1 the trinity assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and george ratliff's documentary , hell house , reflects their earnestness — which makes for a terrifying film . 
-1 offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . 
-1 it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good . 
+1 a wonderful , ghastly film . 
-1 dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
+1 mr . caine and mr . fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances . 
+1 tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to liyan's backyard . 
+1 be prepared to cling to the edge of your seat , tense with suspense . the ring never lets you off the hook . 
-1 i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay . 
+1 as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , 'lovely ! brilliant ! '

-1 even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . . 
+1 belongs to daniel day-lewis as much as it belongs to martin scorsese ; it's a memorable performance in a big , brassy , disturbing , unusual and highly successful film . 
-1 this ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it . 
-1 reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
+1 occasionally funny , always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional almodóvar style . 
+1 director nancy savoca's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could . 
-1 in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
-1  . . . del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
-1 culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
+1 take care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length . 
-1 ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . 
+1 funny and also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness . 
-1 it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture . 
-1 as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
-1 scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! 
+1 take any 12-year-old boy to see this picture , and he'll be your slave for a year . 
-1 the worst film of the year . 
-1 appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites . 
-1 does paint some memorable images . . . , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
+1 the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing . 
+1 idiotic and ugly . 
+1 the film's real appeal won't be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers . 
+1 [westbrook] makes a wonderful subject for the camera . 
-1 this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines . 
+1 nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil . 
-1 the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
+1 while its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite , the film's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving . 
-1 feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
-1 more maudlin than sharp . 
+1 schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms . mirren , who did ) , has succeeded beyond all expectation . 
-1 abysmally pathetic
-1 you can practically hear george orwell turning over . 
+1 a compelling motion picture that illustrates an american tragedy . 
+1 gangster no . 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults . 
+1  . . . digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations . 
-1 with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
+1 purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u . s . foreign policy has played in the rise of castro . 
+1 it's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke . 
-1 they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
-1 plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
-1 if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg . 
-1 the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox . 
-1 who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
-1 sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they'd need a shower . 
-1 these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
-1 like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
-1 an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
+1 superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line . 
+1 peralta captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the dogtown experience . 
+1 it's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought . 
-1 'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '
-1 fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
+1 one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret . 
+1 this is one of polanski's best films . 
+1 the film is . . . determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation . 
-1 all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . 
+1 [cuarón has] created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , and the teenage sex comedy . 
+1 the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . 
+1 this film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion . 
-1 a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 
-1 set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york . 
-1  . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
-1 hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't . 
-1 impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies . 
+1 reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others . it also shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them . 
-1 a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
-1 the sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense . 
-1 uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
+1 a sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one's mother . 
-1 a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
-1 maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this . 
+1 it's immensely ambitious , different than anything that's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it's trying to do . 
-1 weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell . 
+1 dark and disturbing , but also surprisingly funny . 
+1 what 'dumb and dumber' would have been without the vulgarity and with an intelligent , life-affirming script . 
+1 a study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers . . . 
-1 a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
+1 a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive's attention to detail . 
-1 a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan . 
-1 judd's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller smart women , foolish choices for advice . 
-1 there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side . 
+1 niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in hollywood , only god speaks to the press
-1 this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
+1 engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship . 
-1 [the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 
-1 put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
+1 hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels . 
+1  . . . a story , an old and scary one , about the monsters we make , and the vengeance they take . 
-1 yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . 
+1 that haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace . 
+1 moonlight mile doesn't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy . 
+1 a rarity among recent iranian films : it's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist's plight . 
-1 large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better . 
-1 nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
+1 the fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural french school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work . 
-1 the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
+1 an intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist ( not to mention gently political ) meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement . 
+1 one of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm . 
+1 sorvino is delightful in the central role . she nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit . 
+1 meyjes' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil . 
+1 if the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it--the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
-1 a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
-1 its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
+1 even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough . every child's story is what matters . this film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost . 
+1 a flick about our infantilized culture that isn't entirely infantile . 
+1 despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining . 
+1 what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it . 
-1 the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
+1 may be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done . 
+1 it is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad . 
+1 a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films . 
-1 too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet . 
-1 the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 
-1 a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash . 
+1 the weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough . 
-1 the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
+1 same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse . 
-1 audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . 
+1 you might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see " simone , " and consider a dvd rental instead . 
+1 it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure . 
-1 mildly amusing . 
-1 so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines . 
-1 a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing . 
+1 with amazing finesse , the film shadows heidi's trip back to vietnam and the city where her mother , mai thi kim , still lives . 
-1 a non-mystery mystery . 
+1 this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years . 
-1 the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory . 
-1 yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
-1 spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
+1 campanella's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael's evolution . 
+1 a tightly directed , highly professional film that's old-fashioned in all the best possible ways . 
-1 more tiring than anything . 
+1 anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women's self-actualization knows few continental divides . 
-1 [director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one . 
+1 writer-director's mehta's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres . 
-1 most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most . 
+1 it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya . 
+1 this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it . 
-1 watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
+1 what makes the movie special is its utter sincerity . 
+1 while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
-1 an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
-1 its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
-1 a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls . 
-1 clare peploe's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence . 
-1 too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
-1 this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
+1 a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies . 
+1 effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience . 
+1 a rip-roaring comedy action fest that'll put hairs on your chest . 
-1 sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
-1 much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here . 
-1 how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
-1 a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . 
+1 light , cute and forgettable . 
+1 a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship . 
+1 fubar is very funny , but not always in a laugh-out-loud way . 
+1 the am-radio soundtrack and game cast -- tierney and the inimitable walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit . 
+1 a heady , biting , be-bop ride through nighttime manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego . 
-1 solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
+1 the film starts out as competent but unremarkable . . . and gradually grows into something of considerable power . 
+1 i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 
+1 the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question . but this time there's some mold on the gold . 
-1 a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke . 
-1  . . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
-1 a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
-1 resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 
-1 as immaculate as stuart little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous . 
+1 the movie plays up the cartoon's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength . 
+1 not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece . 
-1 distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine . 
-1 in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
+1 measured against practically any like-themed film other than its oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor the silence of the lambs , red dragon rates as an exceptional thriller . 
+1 showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation . 
-1 no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
+1 could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no . 
+1 moore's performance impresses almost as much as her work with haynes in 1995's safe . 
+1 a chilling movie without oppressive gore . 
-1 aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there's little to be learned from watching 'comedian'
-1 the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
-1 the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
+1 entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately . . . dare i say , entertaining ! 
+1  . . . best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the warren report . 
+1 the 3d images only enhance the film's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen . 
+1 a warm , funny , engaging film . 
-1 a mess . the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen . 
+1 para hitler , o mundo era sua tela ; e o horror , seu pincel . e max retrata este fato com elegante abandono , numa triste constatação da realidade histórica . 
-1 a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
-1 whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
-1 flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
-1 short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight… tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
+1 amazing ! a college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing ! 
+1 most consumers of lo mein and general tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it , so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . 
+1 blade ii merges bits and pieces from fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew . 
-1 a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment . 
+1 the directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
-1 a cockeyed shot all the way . 
-1 sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . 
+1 because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions . 
+1 stevens' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls . 
-1 while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
+1 at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary . 
+1 a fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu , ruggero raimondi , and roberto alagna . 
-1 finally coming down off of miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie . 
-1 if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 
+1 it's a talking head documentary , but a great one . 
+1 an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick . 
-1 this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc's , despite a few whopping shootouts . 
+1 davis' candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take on intimate relationships comes to fruition in her sophomore effort . 
-1 so genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen . it never is , not fully . 
-1 if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally , i'd rather watch them on the animal planet . 
+1 a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence . 
-1 the threat implied in the title pokémon 4ever is terrifying – like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
-1 just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . 
-1 there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right . 
+1 ana's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery , as she's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her rubenesque physique . . . 
-1 oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me . 
+1 the piano teacher is not an easy film . it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling . 
-1 unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
-1 there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . 
-1 the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting . 
+1 first-time writer-director serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving , effective little film . 
-1 tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel . 
-1 [gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience . 
+1 this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family . 
+1 a brutal and funny work . nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully . 
+1 a naturally funny film , home movie makes you crave chris smith's next movie . 
-1 the film is flat . 
+1 an original little film about one young woman's education . 
+1 elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it's therapeutic to laugh along with them . 
-1 its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . 
+1 all in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that don't really care for the candidate they're forced to follow . 
-1 no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
+1 there are moments of hilarity to be had . 
-1 a singularly off-putting romantic comedy . 
-1 it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
-1 problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . 
-1 desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
-1 it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
-1 who are 'they' ? well , they're 'they' . they're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like " they're back ! " , " they're out there ! " and " they're coming ! " 
-1 everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 
+1 the film's only missteps come from the script's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale's antics . 
+1 lathan and diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new . 
+1 this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year ! 
-1 don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle . 
+1 more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent . 
-1 these two are generating about as much chemistry as an iraqi factory poised to receive a un inspector . 
+1 beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the marquis de sade had gone in for pastel landscapes . 
+1 leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other . 
+1 a pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place . 
-1 the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
-1 ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
-1  coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
-1 rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down . 
-1 worthy of the gong . 
+1 a huge box-office hit in korea , shiri is a must for genre fans . 
-1 a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . 
+1 this new time machine is hardly perfect… yet it proves surprisingly serviceable . even at its worst , it's not half-bad . 
+1 it's like an old warner bros . costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie errol flynn always wanted to make , though bette davis , cast as joan , would have killed him . 
-1 'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
+1 it's an unusual , thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes . 
-1 'christian bale's quinn [is] a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
+1 nair doesn't treat the issues lightly . she allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly . 
-1 the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style . 
-1 the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
+1 vividly demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop . 
+1 300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness . 
+1 a vivid , sometimes surreal , glimpse into the mysteries of human behavior . 
+1 a gorgeously strange movie , heaven is deeply concerned with morality , but it refuses to spell things out for viewers . 
+1 performances all around are tops , with the two leads delivering oscar-caliber performances . 
-1 the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 
+1 although shot with little style , skins is heartfelt and achingly real . 
+1 a lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe . 
+1 building slowly and subtly , the film , sporting a breezy spontaneity and realistically drawn characterizations , develops into a significant character study that is both moving and wise . 
-1 i'm just too bored to care . 
+1 it's a movie -- and an album -- you won't want to miss . 
+1 there's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , and cq shimmers with it .

-1 tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . " 
-1 though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
-1 what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .

+1 'stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall's intense freight train of a film . '
+1  . . . the first 2/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor . . .

+1 a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation .

-1 [a] poorly executed comedy . 
-1 director-chef gabriele muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale . 
+1 the french are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the americans , who have a passion for musketeers , only to spoof them . 
+1 that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin's film serves up with style and empathy . 
-1 contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .

-1 yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
-1 the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly… alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .

-1 this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .

-1 brisk hack job . 
-1 rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
-1 van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .

+1 a triumph of pure craft and passionate heart . 
-1 this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through . 
+1 this isn't a narrative film -- i don't know if it's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i'm sure some will try -- but it's as close as anyone has dared to come .

+1 deep intelligence and a warm , enveloping affection breathe out of every frame .

+1 even when foreign directors . . . borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting . 
-1 tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
+1 an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction . 
-1 the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . 
-1 must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .

+1 a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well . 
+1 lan yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most american love stories look downright unfree . 
+1 this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it's still a rollicking good time for the most part . 
+1 there's not much to fatale , outside of its stylish surprises . . . but that's ok . 
-1 if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one . 
-1 it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . 
-1 nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
-1  " what john does is heroic , but we don't condone it , " one of the film's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia . 
+1 a must see for all sides of the political spectrum
+1 thanks to the château's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises . 
+1 the ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations . 
+1 a fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man . 
-1 while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . 
-1 the hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone . 
+1 a worthwhile documentary , whether you're into rap or not , even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll . 
+1 béart and berling are both superb , while huppert . . . is magnificent . 
+1 the tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable . 
+1 goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast . 
+1  . . . once the true impact of the day unfolds , the power of this movie is undeniable . 
+1 equilibrium is what george orwell might have imagined had today's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 . 
-1 an incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic . 
-1 a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities . 
+1 light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time . 
-1 for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
-1 manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious . 
-1 the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york . 
+1 the cast is phenomenal , especially the women . 
-1 once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
-1 several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
-1 in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . 
+1 a spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth . 
+1 the script's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off . 
-1 i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama . 
-1 handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
-1 in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie . 
-1 the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 
+1 [russell] makes good b movies ( the mask , the blob ) , and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards . 
+1 if it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for . 
-1 confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 
+1 an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round-robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution . 
+1 schrader examines crane's decline with unblinking candor . 
-1 mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . 
+1 though writer/director bart freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup's anchoring performance . 
+1 despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience . 
+1 i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that . 
+1 bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie . . . is , also , frequently hilarious . 
-1 too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient . 
+1 [kline's] utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who can't quite live up to it . 
+1 mr . polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival . 
+1 it's an interesting effort ( particularly for jfk conspiracy nuts ) , and barry's cold-fish act makes the experience worthwhile . 
-1 muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious . 
+1 ramsay and morton fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling . 
+1 there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises . 
-1 the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face . 
+1 young everlyn sampi , as the courageous molly craig , simply radiates star-power potential in this remarkable and memorable film . 
-1 a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
-1 caso você sinta necessidade de sair da sala antes do término da projeção , não se preocupe : ninguém lhe enviará penas simbolizando covardia . 
-1 to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
-1 the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
+1 [gai] comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form . 
-1 proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
+1 jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he's easy to like and always leaves us laughing . 
-1 often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 
+1 as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting . 
-1 it's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades . 
+1 inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening . 
-1 sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .

-1 what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ? 
-1 resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year .

+1 boisterous and daft documentary . 
-1 what started out as a taut contest of wills between bacon and theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence . 
-1 this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference . 
+1  " the emperor's new clothes " begins with a simple plan . . . . well , at least that's the plan .

-1 it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy . 
-1 an awkward and indigestible movie . 
+1  . . . a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job . . . 
+1 a journey through memory , a celebration of living , and a sobering rumination on fatality , classism , and ignorance . 
+1 spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around . 
+1 a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story . 
-1 flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams . 
+1 if you're not into the pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years won't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open . but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi . 
-1 this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
+1 a sly female empowerment movie , although not in a way anyone would expect . 
+1 it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland . 
+1 if the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start . 
+1 it's a glorious spectacle like those d . w . griffith made in the early days of silent film . 
+1 canadian filmmaker gary burns' inventive and mordantly humorous take on the soullessness of work in the city . 
-1  . . . a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause . 
-1 worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
+1 able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history . 
+1  . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . 
-1 jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . 
-1 mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
+1 so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt . 
-1 only for young children , if them . their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes . 
+1 it's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell . 
+1 there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
+1 what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice . 
+1 delightfully rendered
-1 a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
-1 a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
-1 as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms . redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality . 
-1 the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 
+1 it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart
+1 with so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine . 
+1 it's all entertaining enough , but don't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper . 
+1 a much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation , writer-director anthony friedman's similarly updated 1970 british production . 
+1 it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation . 
-1 it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
-1 the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters . 
-1 a high-minded snoozer . 
+1 thought-provoking and stylish , if also somewhat hermetic . 
-1 it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom . 
+1 a small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad . 
-1 what we get . . . is caddyshack crossed with the loyal order of raccoons . 
-1 the piano teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control . 
-1 a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self… this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people . 
+1 the lady and the duke is eric rohmer's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama
-1 dreary tale of middle-class angst
-1 while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
-1 a little weak -- and it isn't that funny . 
-1 not one moment in the enterprise didn't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow . 
+1 the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson's magnolia and david lynch's mulholland dr . 
-1 the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
+1 as a film director , labute continues to improve . 
+1 a spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages . 
-1 such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard ! 
+1 if there's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr . demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a . addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic . 
-1 as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
+1 drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band . 
-1 both awful and appealing . 
-1  . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 
+1 open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny . 
-1 a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . 
+1 for all the wit and hoopla , festival in cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships . 
-1 the whole film has this sneaky feel to it – as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
-1 considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
+1 will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year . 
-1 an ugly , pointless , stupid movie . 
-1 no movement , no yuks , not much of anything . 
-1 barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time
-1 an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen . 
+1 both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right . 
-1 a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men . 
-1 at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
-1 i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
+1 a smart , arch and rather cold-blooded comedy . 
-1 any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy's sledgehammer sap . 
-1 it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
+1 terrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . 
+1 more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . . 
+1 amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than barbershop . 
+1 frailty isn't as gory or explicit . but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing . 
-1 the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
+1 it's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more . 
+1 shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
-1 there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies . 
-1 slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot . 
+1 like brosnan's performance , evelyn comes from the heart . 
+1 ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but don't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here . 
-1 a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more . 
+1 cho's latest comic set isn't as sharp or as fresh as i'm the one that i want . . . but it's still damn funny stuff . 
-1 with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
+1 the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired . 
-1 the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus . 
-1 bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made . 
-1 with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity . 
+1 despite the predictable parent vs . child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at " the real americans " make this a charmer . 
+1 this version's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful . 
+1 if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 
+1 one of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory , even if it's far tamer than advertised . 
-1 a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
-1 this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
-1 a moving picture that does not move . 
-1 as steamy as last week's pork dumplings . 
-1 when the fire burns out , we've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that's where the film ultimately fails . 
+1 a movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you've actually spent time living in another community . 
-1 dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 
-1 the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
+1 with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives . 
-1 this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic . 
-1 we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 
-1 unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
+1 shanghai ghetto , much stranger than any fiction , brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life . 
-1 this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . 
-1 an ugly , revolting movie . 
+1 this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . 
-1 it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
+1 intimate and panoramic . 
+1 throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love's brief moment . 
-1 will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ? 
+1 barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful . 
-1 the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
+1 you've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but it's worth yet another visit . 
+1 a fascinating , dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction . 
+1 one of [herzog's] least inspired works . 
+1 crammed with incident , and bristles with passion and energy . 
-1 it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
+1 it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip . 
-1 a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
-1 like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q . is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause . 
-1 plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . 
+1 so young , so smart , such talent , such a wise * * * . 
+1 hoffman's performance is authentic to the core of his being . 
+1 a timely look back at civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices . 
+1 if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere . 
-1 the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
-1 the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
+1 maggie smith as the ya-ya member with the o2-tank will absolutely crack you up with her crass , then gasp for gas , verbal deportment . 
+1 a whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking christian-themed fun . 
+1 like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr . wong's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting . 
+1 a densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean-luc godard's finest work . 
-1 a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional . 
+1 fun and nimble . 
-1 is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
+1 devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable . 
+1 rarely , a movie is more than a movie . go . 
+1 sum " is jack ryan's " do-over . " give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works . especially give credit to affleck . 
-1 the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
-1 at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer . 
-1 the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
+1 the year's greatest adventure , and jackson's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate . 
-1 blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
+1 the bard as black comedy -- willie would have loved it . 
-1 if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way . 
+1 has an unmistakable , easy joie de vivre . 
+1 it sounds sick and twisted , but the miracle of shainberg's film is that it truly is romance
-1 a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality . 
+1 it all plays out . . . like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller's time out . 
-1 the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 
+1 quietly engaging . 
-1 in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
-1 you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
+1  . it's a testament to the film's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries . there's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls . . . 
+1 nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one . 
+1 celebrated at sundance , this slight comedy of manners has winning performances and a glossy , glib charm that's hard to beat . 
-1 the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . 
-1 mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . 
+1 uneven but a lot of fun . 
+1 a confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design . 
-1 screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . 
-1 the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
-1 the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
-1 you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy . 
-1 jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . 
+1 sly , sophisticated and surprising . 
+1 a lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers . 
+1 so original in its base concept that you cannot help but get caught up . 
+1 an absurdist spider web . 
-1 a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
-1 meanders between its powerful moments . 
+1  . . . wise and elegiac . . . 
+1 morvern callar confirms lynne ramsay as an important , original talent in international cinema . 
+1 a solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude . 
-1 unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .

+1 when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra , it finds a nice rhythm . 
-1 a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
-1 sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end . 
+1 whereas oliver stone's conspiracy thriller jfk was long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy , interview with the assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity . 
+1 a romantic comedy , yes , but one with characters who think and talk about their goals , and are working on hard decisions . 
+1 its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .

-1 the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
-1 ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability .

+1 on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion . 
-1 such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
+1 occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new . 
+1 the plot twists give i am trying to break your heart an attraction it desperately needed . 
-1 this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand .

+1 the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . 
+1 the kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you .

+1 munch's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters . he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities . his scenes are short and often unexpected .

+1 lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie . 
-1 director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks . 
+1  . . . a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy . . . 
-1 directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting . 
+1 a tasty masala . 
+1 the very definition of the 'small' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher . 
-1 a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 
+1 brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate . 
-1 for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie . 
+1 this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire . 
-1 ah-nuld's action hero days might be over . 
+1 director andrew niccol . . . demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame . his healthy sense of satire is light and fun . . . . 
-1 from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
+1 although tender and touching , the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing . 
-1 [less a movie than] an appalling , odoriferous thing . . . so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you'll want to crawl up your own * * * in embarrassment . 
+1 it's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer . 
+1 [has] an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it's all true . 
+1 a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite . it's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones . 
-1 a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . 
-1 the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
-1  it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 
+1 here's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep . but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned cannot be said to suck . 
+1 there is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care . 
-1 if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it . 
+1 the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul . . . he elevates the experience to a more mythic level . 
+1 an effectively creepy , fear-inducing ( not fear-reducing ) film from japanese director hideo nakata , who takes the superstitious curse on chain letters and actually applies it . 
+1 worth a look as a curiosity . 
+1 fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life . 
-1 when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . 
+1 while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy . 
+1 writer and director otar iosseliani's pleasant tale about a factory worker who escapes for a holiday in venice reveals how we all need a playful respite from the grind to refresh our souls . 
+1 it's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but westbrook's foundation and dalrymple's film earn their uplift . 
+1 the path ice age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros . giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie's release . 
-1 it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
-1 hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry . 
-1 sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre . 
-1 'carente de imaginación , mal dirigida , peor actuada y sin un ápice de romance , es una verdadera pérdida de tiempo y dinero'
-1 leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances . 
-1 heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
+1 this masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short . 
+1 may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today . 
-1 you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
+1 over the years , hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor . 
-1 reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script
-1 a sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer . 
-1 despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
-1 evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
+1 only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents . 
+1 workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies . 
-1 the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
+1 we learn a lot about dying coral and see a lot of life on the reef . 
+1 to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest . 
-1 while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
+1 the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . 
-1 with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
-1 as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
+1 skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults . 
+1 it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing . 
+1 its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work . 
-1 just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite . 
+1 painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances . 
+1 a clever blend of fact and fiction . 
+1 though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation . 
-1 since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 
+1 sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film . one of the best of the year . 
+1 with few respites , marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it . 
+1 this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics . 
+1 hayek is stunning as frida and . . . a star-making project . 
+1 although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious . 
+1 son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness . 
+1 this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . in fact , it's quite fun in places . 
-1 it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter . 
+1 the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids . 
-1 imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . 
+1 the performances take the movie to a higher level . 
-1 has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
+1 changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say . 
+1 a sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern china . 
+1 well-acted , well-directed and , for all its moodiness , not too pretentious . 
+1 the chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between gauls and yanks . 
+1 the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride . 
-1 the movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth . 
+1 a much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe . 
+1 kudos to the most enchanting film of the year . 
-1 not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 
-1 viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm's performance , the film would be a total washout . 
-1 the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . " 
-1 what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
+1 an original gem about an obsession with time . 
-1 plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
+1 it's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this " two weddings and a funeral " fun . 
+1 if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 
-1 there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 
+1 a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans ( but by no means all ) will have fun with . 
-1 after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . 
-1 this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there . 
-1 moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured . 
+1 the film's unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths . entirely appropriately , the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn . 
+1 the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before . 
+1 a charming , banter-filled comedy . . . one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface . 
-1 a hit- and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped . 
+1 while broomfield's film doesn't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system . 
+1 at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story . however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts . 
-1 koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
+1 eyre is on his way to becoming the american indian spike lee . 
-1 while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot . 
+1 a winning piece of work filled with love for the movies of the 1960s . 
+1 the film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant . 
+1 majidi's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times . 
+1  . . . the implication is kissinger may have decided that — when it comes to truncheoning — it's better to give than to receive . 
+1 jolting into charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent ( accurate ? who cares ? ) . 
+1 nicely combines the enigmatic features of 'memento' with the hallucinatory drug culture of 'requiem for a dream . '
-1 william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
-1 an extremely unpleasant film . 
+1 ya-yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film . 
-1 at the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion . 
-1 when mr . hundert tells us in his narration that 'this is a story without surprises , ' we nod in agreement . 
+1 uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious spoof . 
-1 it's like a drive-by . you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise . 
+1 a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic . . . 
+1 the film is full of charm . 
+1 absorbing character study by andré turpin . 
+1 like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie doesn't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome . 
-1 tends to plod . 
-1 it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
-1 drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
-1  " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
+1 every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you're on the edge of your seat . 
+1 much of this slick and sprightly cgi feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings . 
+1 an uplifting , near-masterpiece . 
-1 the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
-1 tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
+1 there is a kind of attentive concern that hoffman brings to his characters , as if he has been giving them private lessons , and now it is time for their first public recital . 
-1 never inspires more than an interested detachment . 
-1 this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same . 
+1 but this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it's about a very human one . 
+1 an undeniably gorgeous , terminally smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band . 
+1 as lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that george lucas has long forgotten . 
+1 manages to delight without much of a story . 
-1 just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
-1 a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground . 
-1 this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
+1 'film aficionados cannot help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director's cut . '
+1 without [de niro] , city by the sea would slip under the waves . he drags it back , single-handed . 
-1 bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script . 
+1 the delicious trimmings…arrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minute…with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind's liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two . 
+1 pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance . 
-1 cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed . 
+1 like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series . 
-1 it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen . 
-1 sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . 
-1 we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest . 
+1 the story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one . 
-1 debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish . 
-1 hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire . 
-1 there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 
+1 sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy . . . attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called 'my husband is travis bickle' . 
-1 so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script . 
-1 this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
-1 the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
-1 it's just not very smart . 
-1 though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear . 
-1 george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
+1 the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece .
